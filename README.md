### Hi there 👋
- 👨🏼‍🎓 I’m a grad student at University of Washington's GIX program and will graduate in December of this year!

- 😎 I have a unique background with a degree in IT Networking and experience in Python, Linux, Java, and JavaScript.
- 👷🏼 I currently work at the Maker Space @ UW's Global Innovation Exchange.
- 🌱 I'm learning as much about data structures & algorithms as possible w/[AlgoExpert](https://algoexpert.io).
