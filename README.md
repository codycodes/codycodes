### Hi there 👋
- 👨🏼‍🎓 I’m a recent grad from University of Washington's interdisciplinary GIX program!
- 🛩 For our capstone w/Microsoft & Port of Seattle, we developed a prototype to reduce greenhouse gases by 27,000lbs/year for docked planes.
- 😎 I have a unique background with a degree in IT Networking and experience in cloud engineering, Python, Linux, Java, and JavaScript.
- 👷🏼 I have an affinity for makerspaces and making things (prev. Maker Space @ UW's Global Innovation Exchange.)
- 🌱 I'm learning as much about data structures & algorithms as possible w/[AlgoExpert](https://algoexpert.io).
- 🏡 And I'm also a big fan of [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io), IoT, and open source software in general.
